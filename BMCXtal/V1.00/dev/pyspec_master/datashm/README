Find here files to build the datashm extension for python.

Use the options:
  --specsrc={directory}  # to specify where the spec sources are containing
                         # sps.c sps.h and spec_shm.h
and 
  --install-lib={directory}   # to specify the installation directory for the module
  --prefix={directory}        # to specify the installation directory for the module

The difference between the two options is that --install-lib will install the module
directly under the specified directory.  --prefix will install it in a directory of
the type {directory}/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages

Example:

python setup.py --specsrc=.. install --install-lib=/usr/local/lib/spec.d

(the order is important as --specsrc is an option for setup.py and --install-lib and --prefix 
   are options for the install command)

The installation process will create a build directory that you can disposed of after
installation
